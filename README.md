# 🧠 Sentient Debugger + Adaptive Test Architect

An offline, self-learning AI coding assistant that observes your workflow, understands your habits, and intelligently adapts — offering contextual code suggestions, dynamic test generation, and architectural insights as you code. It’s like pairing with a senior engineer who learns *your* style over time.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Self-Learning**: Unlike Copilot, this tool fine-tunes a local model on your own codebase and style.
- **Offline + Private**: No cloud APIs — perfect for proprietary, secure, or air-gapped environments.
- **Test-Aware**: It dynamically writes and updates unit tests as your code evolves.
- **Cross-Language**: Built with Tree-sitter and Rust to support static analysis for many languages.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧠 **Local LLM Adapter** — Runs with `LLaMA.cpp`, `ONNX`, or other portable models for code comprehension and suggestion.
- 🪵 **Real-Time File Watcher** — Monitors your code directory and triggers analysis on save.
- 🔍 **Static Analysis Layer** — Parses your syntax tree using Rust and Tree-sitter.
- 🧬 **Style Embedding Engine** — Learns your function structure, naming patterns, and architecture choices.
- 🧪 **Adaptive Test Writer** — Writes new unit tests and updates old ones as logic changes.
- 🖥️ **(Optional) Tauri UI** — Clean, cross-platform Electron alternative for running and visualizing insights.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Rust + Cargo
- macOS (or any Unix-like system)
- (Optional) [LLaMA.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or ONNX model
- (Optional) [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) if using GUI

### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentient-debugger.git
cd sentient-debugger
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cargo build --manifest-path static_analysis/Cargo.toml

🚦 Usage
Start the debugger on your project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
python launch.py --watch ~/dev/my-cool-project
Once running, the debugger will:

Parse file changes.

Extract coding patterns.

Suggest inline improvements (via CLI or GUI).

Write test cases to tests/generated/.

🧠 Model Support
Default integration supports:

LLaMA.cpp for ultra-light local inference

ONNX runtime for pretrained transformer models

Style embedding uses sentence-transformers + FAISS for similarity search.

🧪 Test Evolution Engine
Auto-writes tests like:

python
Copy
Edit
# Generated by Sentient Debugger on 2025-05-18
def test_process_data_edge_case():
    result = process_data([])
    assert result == {}
🛡️ Security & Privacy
Entirely offline.

No data leaves your machine.

Ideal for secure coding environments.

🌐 Future Roadmap
 Auto-refactor suggestions via GUI.

 Git diff learning to track developer evolution.

 Collaborative mode for team behavior synthesis.
